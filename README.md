# 🌾 Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System using Machine Learning

This project provides an intelligent solution for recommending the most suitable crop and fertilizer based on soil and environmental parameters using Machine Learning. The goal is to help farmers and agricultural planners make data-driven decisions to improve yield and soil health.

## 📌 Features

- Predict the best crop to grow based on:
  - Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) levels
  - pH of the soil
  - Temperature and Humidity
  - Rainfall

- Recommend optimal fertilizers based on:
  - Nutrient deficiencies or excesses
  - Crop nutrient requirements

- Interactive web interface (optional: Streamlit or Flask)
- Scalable and adaptable to regional data

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- **Crop Recommendation:**
  - Random Forest Classifier (best performance)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- **Fertilizer Recommendation:**
  - Rule-based system using nutrient delta logic
  - Optionally enhanced with decision trees or Naive Bayes
